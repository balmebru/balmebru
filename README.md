Hi there! Iâ€™m Bruno, a computational biology student deeply interested in the intersection of ML, AI, and bioprocess technology. I'm diving into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop predictive models that require minimal labeling, aiming to make these tools both powerful and efficient.

Areas of Focus
Computer Vision: Eager to collaborate on segmentation, classification, and prediction tasks.
Model Robustness: Working to adapt models for real-world applications, where data can be much messier than typical training sets.
Automatic Labeling & Classification: Passionate about setting up streamlined labeling processes for better, faster results.
Feel free to reach out if you have any cell-based questions or need insights into setting up automatic labeling systems and classification models!
